    <h2>COACHING PHILOSOPHY</h2>
    <p> Consistent with Notre Dame's mission, the Lancers baseball program strives to build character in our student-athletes using baseball as our vehicle. Some of the qualities our young men will always possess are integrity, work ethic, respect, selflessness, and gratitude. We will accomplish this through team building.</p> 
    <p>Being a great teammate will always be paramount in our program. Through ND baseball, our boys will become better members of all the groups that they belong to. Their most important team will always be their family, and along those lines we will strive to help them become the best teammates they can be on that important team. Now, as a son and brother (if they have siblings); later in life as a husband and father if they are so blessed. It is one of the reasons why you will often hear us shout “family” after team huddles.</p>
    <p> An underlying goal for our coaching staff is to instill their love for the great game of baseball in our student athletes. This will lead to greater enjoyment and a more gratifying experience. Baseball should be fun, win or lose, and enjoying that time on the field will always be a priority at Notre Dame. Combining that love with playing with an unmatched enthusiasm and energy, leads to greater success and meaningful memories that will last a lifetime.</p>

    <h2>COACHING STAFF</h2>
    <img src='./coache.jpg' alt="Coaching Staff">
    <ul>
      <li class="odd"> <h3>Coach Jeff Rago</h3>
        <p>Coach Jeff Rago began his career as a school counselor and coach in 1994 at Greenwich High School. Coach then moved north in 2000 and became a middle school counselor and started coaching at Trumbull High School in 2001. After several years at THS as an assistant, Coach Rago was ready to run his own program.
          Rago was named the head coach at Joel Barlow High School prior to the 2008 season, and knew that he had a big job in front of him. Barlow baseball was down and losing athletes to other sports. In 2008, there were just 24 players grades 9-12 at JB. 
          In 2015, the program had grown so significantly that Barlow added a freshmen team due to the 70 student-athletes that came out for the program that spring. Coach was largely responsible in rebuilding JB baseball into the powerhouse that it is today.
          Under Coach Rago’s leadership, JBHS baseball won many individual and team awards, raised the money and the support for the building of a brand new varsity baseball field, led a charge to bring American Legion and AAU baseball to the Barlow community, and started developing college baseball talent.
          Coach stepped down in 2015 due to some health issues and to see his own children play high school sports. 
        </p>
        <p> Rago returned to coaching in 2021 serving as an assistant at Weston High School before being named the head coach at Notre Dame for the 2024 season. ND baseball excelled in year one under Rago with an impressive 14-6 regular season record (quite an improvement from 4-16 in 2023). 
          This earned the team league and state playoff births. Rago‘s teambuilding approach, attention to detail, focus on the fundamentals of the game, and his insistence for unparalleled effort, energy, and enthusiasm has already turned the program around. 
          </p>
          <p> 
          As a player, Rago played his college ball at D2 Queens College in New York. He and his wife Kim were married in 1994 and have 3 amazing kids (Gabby, Sean, and Samantha). </p>

        <li class="even"> <h3>Coach Joseph Pagan</h3>
          <p>Coach Joseph Pagan, a lifelong resident of Bridgeport, CT,began his coaching career in 2009 after returning home from playing two years of professional independent baseball. Joe’s first stop in his coaching journey brought him to his alma-mater,Bridgeport Central High School, where he served as assistant varsity coach. Je was brought in to help revamp the baseball program. While starting in coaching, he also began his career with the Department of Corrections.  Two years later he was named the head coach at Bridgeport Central High School. For 13 years, Joe balanced work and high school coaching, also becoming the head baseball coach for Bridgeport Junior American Legion. This was all part of his vision to help bring baseball back to Bridgeport.  During his time at Central and with Bridgeport Legion, Joe has helped to shape the young men who he’s coached.  Several of his players moved on the play collegiate baseball at institutions like Post University, Bates College, Eastern CT State, and Monroe College. Coach also takes great pride in the fact that several of his players chose to serve our country by enlisting in the military. The Central High School baseball team went on to be City Champs 8 years running, while also winning the Fairfield County Umpires Association Sportsmanship Award on multiple occasions.  In the Fall of 2020, Joe assisted in co-founding the Bridgeport Bluefish Travel AAU Baseball Program continuing his goal of bringing baseball back to Bridgeport.  After his successful tenure atBridgeport Central, it was time for a well-deserved exhale, and Joe stepped down at the end of the 2022 season. Time away from high school coaching proved to be just too difficult and in 2023 Joe was brought on to be the Assistant Varsity Head Coach at Notre Dame. In the new coaching staff’s first year, ND had one of the best regular seasons in several years going 14-6, earning league and state playoff appearances.  Joe’s focus on accountability, pride, and discipline, blends well with the values of the program and will help ensure the bright future ahead. </p>
              <p>Joe played collegiately for the Owls of Southern Connecticut State University. He became an intricate part of the program’s success from 2002-2005 where SCSU won their first ever Northeast-10 Conference Championship. They went on to win the Northeast Regional Championship that same year qualifying SCSU to make its first ever appearance at the Division II College World Series in Montgomery, Alabama. In his senior season at Southern, Joe was named Team Captain and lead the Owls to a second straight Regional Championship game. Joe ended his career at Southern with Northeast-10 All Conference Honors, Regional Tournament All Tournament First Team honors, but most importantly graduated in 2006 with his B.A. in Communications. In January of 2007 Joe signed a free agent contract with the Continental Independent Baseball League taking his talents to Dallas, Texas. Joe became the face of the Tarrant County Blue Thunder franchise capturing League All-Star honors batting an impressive .357, leading the league in RBI (54) and Home Runs (20). The team went on to win the CBL Championship in 2007 and Joe was named CBL Championship Series MVP. In 2008 Joe was traded to the Schaumberg Flyers of the Northern Independent Baseball League in Chicago, IL. He was sent back to Dallas before the 2008 season where he would finish out his playing career being named to the league All-Star team once again. Coach Pagan now lives in Bridgeport with his wife Alexis and sons Caleb and Canaan.</p>
